This repository hosts a simple calculator application implemented in Java.The calculator provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing library. 
Users can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, the calculator supports exponentiation, modulus, and negation functionalities.
Features User-Friendly Interface: The calculator offers a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to input numbers and perform calculations.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform common arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
Advanced Operations: In addition to basic operations, the calculator also supports advanced functionalities such as exponentiation (^), modulus (%), and negation (-1).
Clear Functionality: Users can clear the input field with a single click using the "CLR" button, allowing for easy correction of inputs.
UsageRunning the Program: Execute the Java program to launch the calculator application.
Inputting Numbers: Use the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers into the calculator.Performing Operations: Click on the corresponding operation buttons (+, -, *, /, ^, %) to perform arithmetic operations.Negation: The "(-1)" button allows users to negate the current number.
Decimal Point: Use the "." button to input decimal points for floating-point numbers.
Deleting Entries: The "DEL" button removes the last entered digit from the input field.
Obtaining Results: Click on the "=" button to compute the result of the entered expression.
